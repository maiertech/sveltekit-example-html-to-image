# sveltekit-example-html-to-image

In this example I test [html-to-image](https://github.com/bubkoo/html-to-image) for client-side and server-side image generation.

## Test client-side image generation

- Simple div with some text.
- Button that triggers download of div as image.

## Test server-side image generation

- Provide a URL to endpoint.
- Render with jsdom or happy-dom.
- Create image and return it.
